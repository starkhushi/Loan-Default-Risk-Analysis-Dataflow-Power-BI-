# Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis-Dataflow-Power-BI- 
# ðŸ’³ Loan Default Risk Analysis with Dataflow, Snowflake, AWS & Power BI  

ðŸ“Š A complete **data engineering + analytics project** designed to assess **loan default risks** by integrating cloud-based data pipelines with advanced visualization dashboards.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

Financial institutions face challenges in understanding **borrower risk profiles** and minimizing loan defaults.  
This project leverages **Google Dataflow, Snowflake, AWS, and Power BI** to build a scalable data pipeline and deliver **actionable insights** into borrower behavior.  

**Key Business Questions Addressed:**  
- What demographic and financial factors contribute most to loan defaults?  
- How do default rates vary by employment type, age group, and credit score?  
- What are the YOY trends in loan amounts and defaults?  
- How can credit risk be segmented for better decision-making?

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  

- **Data Ingestion & ETL**: Google Dataflow  
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake  
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3  
- **Querying & Analysis**: BigQuery, SQL  
- **Visualization**: Power BI (DAX, KPIs, Interactive Dashboards)
